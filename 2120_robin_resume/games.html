        <p>I have always been inspired by games, personally viewing them as technical pieces of art. But being who I am, I couldn't simply enjoy video games. I want to know everything about what makes them work. 
            To do this I have developed the hobby of developing games, or at least small projects that don't have a scope of 5 years with a team. I do what I can, and have so far enjoyed the process tremendously. 
            Because I am not simply trying to release a game, but rather attempting to learn everything there is to know about games, I don't stick to only the programming. 
            I have also learned how to 3D model, rig, animate, and even the basics of music composition. 
            Though I have been practicing this hobby for almost 5 years now whenever I have time, I have barely gotten to the tip of the iceberg and Imagine having fun with it for decades to come.</p>
